Task Manager App - README
Overview

The Task Manager app is a simple task management application built for Android. It allows users to add tasks. Developed using Kotlin and XML and it leverages Room Database to store tasks locally on the device, ensuring data persistence even after the app is closed.
Features
    Add Task: Users can easily add new tasks to the list.
    Room Database: The app uses Room Database for storing tasks locally on the device.

Installation

To run the app:

    Clone or download the project.
    Open the project in Android Studio.
    Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

How to Use

    Add a Task: Tap on the "Add Task" button to enter a task description and save it to the list.
    Delete a Task: Swipe a task left or right to delete it from the list.
    The tasks will be saved and persist even after the app is closed and reopened, thanks to Room Database.

To-Do

    Delete Task: The ability to delete tasks from the list (currently not implemented). This will be added in a future update, with options like swiping to delete or a delete button on each task.
